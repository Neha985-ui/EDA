    "How Heteroscedasticity Affects Multiple Linear Regression:\n",
    "Invalid Standard Errors:\n",
    "One of the most significant impacts of heteroscedasticity is that it can distort the estimation of standard errors of the\n",

    "is not significant when it actually is (Type II error).\n",
    "Bias in Coefficient Estimates:\n",
    "While heteroscedasticity does not bias the estimated coefficients themselves (i.e., the regression model remains unbiased in \n",
    "terms of the point estimates of the coefficients), it can lead to inefficient estimates. This means the coefficients could be\n",

    "Inefficient Hypothesis Testing:\n",

    "dependent variable because the predictors are not truly independent. Multicollinearity can lead to:\n",
    "- **Unstable coefficients**: Small changes in the data can cause large changes in the coefficient estimates.\n",
    "- **Inflated standard errors**: Making it difficult to determine which variables are statistically significant.\n",
    "- **Difficulty in interpreting coefficients**: Since correlated predictors are hard to separate, it can become unclear what\n",
    "each predictor truly represents.\n",
    "Methods to Improve a Multiple Linear Regression Model with High Multicollinearity:\n",
    "1. **Remove Highly Correlated Predictors**\n",
    "   - **Identify highly correlated predictors**: Use correlation matrices, **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**, or **pairwise\n",
    "   scatterplots** to detect which predictors are highly correlated.\n",
    "   - **Remove one of the correlated predictors**: If two variables are highly correlated (e.g., \\( \\text{Correlation} > 0.9 \\))\n",

    "   the model.\n",
    "2. **Combine Correlated Predictors (Principal Component Analysis)**\n",
    "   - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms correlated variables\n",
    "   into a smaller number of uncorrelated components. You can use the principal components as predictors in your model instead\n",
    "   of the original highly correlated variables.\n",
    "   - **Advantages**: PCA helps retain most of the variance in the data while reducing multicollinearity, but interpreting the\n",
    "   components may be less intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Regularization Techniques (Ridge or Lasso Regression)**\n",
    "   - **Ridge Regression**: Ridge regression adds a penalty term (L2 regularization) to the cost function. This penalizes large\n",
    "   coefficients, which helps to reduce their variance and mitigate the impact of multicollinearity.\n",
    "     - **Effect**: Ridge shrinks the coefficients of correlated variables, helping to stabilize the model.\n",
    "   - **Lasso Regression**: Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) is another regularization method\n",
    "   (L1 regularization) that not only shrinks coefficients but can also set some of them to zero, effectively performing\n",
    "   variable selection. This can help eliminate less important predictors and reduce multicollinearity.\n",
    "     - **Effect**: Lasso helps identify the most important predictors by forcing some coefficients to zero, potentially\n",
    "     removing them from the model.\n",

    "4. **Combine Variables into a Single Predictor (Domain Knowledge)**\n",
    "   - If you have **domain knowledge** suggesting that two or more predictors are conceptually similar or can be combined, you\n",

    "     - Taking the **average** or **sum** of the correlated variables.\n",
    "     - Creating an **index** or **score** that represents the combined effect of the variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Increase the Sample Size**\n",
    "   - **Larger datasets** can help reduce the impact of multicollinearity. With more data, the model can better estimate the\n",
    "   coefficients of correlated variables, and multicollinearity’s influence may be reduced.\n",
    "   - While this approach may not directly solve multicollinearity, it can improve the stability and accuracy of the model by\n",

    "\n",
    " 6. **Drop the Intercept (Rarely Used)**\n",
    "   - In some cases, dropping the intercept term from the model can help reduce multicollinearity, but this is rare and not \n",

    "**Label encoding** assigns a unique numeric value to each category in a categorical variable. Each category is mapped to an\n",
    "integer, starting from 0 or 1, depending on the implementation.\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "For the categorical variable \"Size\" with values (Small, Medium, Large), label encoding would map:\n",
    "- Small = 0\n",
    "- Medium = 1\n",
    "- Large = 2\n",
    " When to Use:\n",
    "- Label encoding is suitable for **ordinal** variables, where there is a natural order (e.g., Low, Medium, High).\n",
    "- It's not ideal for nominal variables (where categories don’t have a meaningful order), as the model may interpret the\n",
    "numeric values as having an ordinal relationship (which they don't), potentially introducing unintended relationships.\n",
    "3. **Ordinal Encoding**\n",
    "Ordinal encoding** is similar to label encoding but specifically designed for **ordinal variables**, where the categories have\n",
    "a natural order (e.g., education level: High School < Bachelor’s < Master’s < PhD). In ordinal encoding, the categories are \n",
    "assigned integer values based on their rank or order.\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "For the categorical variable \"Education Level\" with values (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD), ordinal encoding would\n",
    "map:\n",
    "- High School = 1\n",
    "- Bachelor’s = 2\n",
    "- Master’s = 3\n",
    "- PhD = 4\n",
    "When to Use:\n",
    "- Ordinal encoding is best used when you have **ordinal** variables, where the order matters, but the differences between\n",
    "adjacent categories might not be uniform.\n",
    "4. **Target Encoding (Mean Encoding)**\n",
    "Target encoding** involves encoding the categories of a categorical variable based on the mean of the target variable (the\n",
    "dependent variable) for each category. This method replaces each category with the average value of the target variable for \n",
    "that category.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you have a categorical variable \"Region\" and a target variable \"Sales\". For each region (e.g., North, South, East, \n",
    "West), the target encoding would replace the category with the average sales in that region.\n",
    " When to Use:\n",
    "- Target encoding is useful when the categorical variable has many categories or when you want to capture relationships between\n",
    "the categories and the target variable.\n",
    "- Caution: It can introduce **data leakage** if applied incorrectly (i.e., using information from the test set to encode the\n",
    "training set), so it's important to apply target encoding only on the training data and ensure proper cross-validation.\n",
    "5. **Binary Encoding**\n",
    "Binary encoding** is a more compact alternative to one-hot encoding, especially useful when dealing with categorical variables\n",
    "that have many categories. The categories are first converted to integer values, then those integers are converted into binary\n",
    "code. Each binary digit becomes a separate feature.\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "For a categorical variable \"ID\" with values (A, B, C, D), first, assign integer values:\n",
    "- A = 0, B = 1, C = 2, D = 3\n",
    "Then convert these values to binary:\n",
    "- A = 00\n",
    "- B = 01\n",
    "- C = 10\n",
    "- D = 11\n",
    "\n",
    "Each binary digit (0 or 1) is placed into a separate column, reducing the number of columns compared to one-hot encoding.\n",
    "When to Use:\n",
    "- Binary encoding is useful when the categorical variable has a large number of categories, as it reduces the dimensionality \n",
    "compared to one-hot encoding.\n",
    " 6. **Frequency (Count) Encoding**\n",
    "Frequency encoding** involves replacing each category in a categorical variable with the **frequency** or **count** of that\n",
    "category in the dataset. This approach encodes each category as the number of times it appears in the dataset.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "For the categorical variable \"Product Type\" with values (A, B, C), the frequencies might be:\n",
    "- A = 100 occurrences\n",
    "- B = 50 occurrences\n",
    "- C = 25 occurrences\n",
    "Then, \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\" are replaced with these counts (100, 50, and 25).\n",
    " When to Use:\n",
    "- Frequency encoding can be useful when the frequency of the categories is informative for the prediction task.\n",
    "- It's often applied in cases where one-hot encoding would create too many columns, or where certain categories’ frequency may\n",
    "have predictive power.\n",
    "7. **Hashing Encoding (Feature Hashing)**\n",
    "Hashing encoding** is a technique that reduces the dimensionality of the transformed categorical features by applying a hash \n",
    "function to the categorical variable and mapping each category to a fixed-length vector. This approach is especially helpful\n",
    "when dealing with categorical variables with a very high cardinality (many unique categories).\n",
    " When to Use:\n",
    "- Hashing encoding is effective when the dataset has categorical variables with a large number of categories (e.g., in text \n",
    "classification tasks where words are treated as categorical features).\n",
    "- It's less interpretable than other methods because of the loss of the original category names.\n"
